- stepsWeeklyGoal
- workoutsWeeklyGoal 


  //This data needs pulled from DB 

  //Daily inputs 
  const cardioProgress = 110
  const stepsProgress =  1999
  const workoutProgress = 1;


  // Weekly progression amount - ( cardioPropress + cardioWeeklyProgress ) - This would need to be submiting every night at 12:00 

// Weekly Goal 
  const cardioWeeklyGoal = 210
  const stepsWeeklyGoal =  56000
